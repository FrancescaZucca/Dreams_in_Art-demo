DreamsinArt01,DreamVision_Durer.jpg,Dream Vision,image/jpeg,Albrecht Durer,1525,,single-page; photographs,"Vienna, Austria",48.193814847823 16.382611474323703,16.382611474323703,,Kunsthistorisches Museum,Image;StillImage,Watercolour on paper,30 x 43 cm,"The watercolour and accompanying text describe an apocalyptic dream which Dürer had on the night of 7-8 June 1525. The picture depicts a landscape with scattered trees. An enormous column of water gushes down, spreading out near the ground and flooding, while other smaller columns of water start to fall from the heavens. The dream occurred during a period of great religious uncertainty, with the birth of the Reformation, and many people feared that a flood would destroy the world.

Below the watercolour Dürer wrote a description of his dream:

`In 1525, during the night between Wednesday and Thursday after Whitsuntide, I had this vision in my sleep, and saw how many great waters fell from heaven. The first struck the ground about four miles away from me with such a terrible force, enormous noise and splashing that it drowned the entire countryside. I was so greatly shocked at this that I awoke before the cloudburst. And the ensuing downpour was huge. Some of the waters fell some distance away and some close by. And they came from such a height that they seemed to fall at an equally slow pace. But the very first water that hit the ground so suddenly had fallen at such velocity, and was accompanied by wind and roaring so frightening, that when I awoke my whole body trembled and I could not recover for a long time. When I arose in the morning, I painted the above as I had seen it. May the Lord turn all things to the best.'

In the draft of his unpublished `Nourishment for Young Painters', dating from over a decade earlier, Dürer had written: `How often do I see great art in my sleep, but on waking cannot recall it; as soon as I awake, my memory forgets it.' But on this occasion, Dürer made great efforts to recall the dream and painstakingly recorded it in an image and words. The result is probably one of the most realistic early depictions of a scene accurately recalled from a dream, as opposed to more composed visions which had previously figured in European paintings and illuminated manuscripts."

The painting depicts Saint Joseph, the father of Jesus, being visited in a dream by an angel with a message. According to the New Testament he was actually visited four times with various messages and it is not clear in this case which visit is being portrayed. It is most likely to represent the second visit in which Joseph is advised to leave Bethlehem and seek sanctuary for the Holy Family in Egypt.

Typical of many of de La Tour's works, a chiaroscuro effect is achieved by lighting the scene with a candle."

It shows a woman in deep sleep with her arms thrown below her, and with a demonic and ape-like incubus crouched on her chest. The painting's dreamlike and haunting erotic evocation of infatuation and obsession was a huge popular success.

After its first exhibition, at the 1782 Royal Academy of London, critics and patrons reacted with horrified fascination and the work became widely popular, to the extent that it was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced at least three other versions.

Interpretations vary. The canvas seems to portray simultaneously a dreaming woman and the content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists.[1] Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious."

The dreamer (Ruins of the Oybin Monastery) is a painting that carries a deeper meaning when closely studied. It was a painting created to show nature on its finest. The painting contains a single man, sitting on a window base in the gothic ruins demonstrating a distressed expression. Friedrich might have intended to show the imagery of an abandoned person. His theme in paintings revolved around romance, nature and spiritual experiences of life and The dreamer was no different.

Caspar had created several paintings before he created The dreamer from 1820-1840. The Landscape with Temple Ruins was his first creation which happened in 1797. He later created many more paintings before creation of Ruins of the Oybin Monastery. The theme in this painting was continued in the creation of Chamber Cloth Dreamer. He made a clear illustration of a hero-like figure sitting on the base of a window on a Gothic ruin. It gives a clear image of man have colliding thoughts of both his present and future. Despite being in this devastating state, the painting shows that the man has no one to lean on."

It is a fantastical depiction of a lion musing over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night.

Rousseau first exhibited the painting at the 13th Salon des Indépendants, and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the mayor of his hometown, Laval. Instead, it entered the private collection of a Parisian charcoal merchant where it remained until 1924, when it was discovered by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles. The Paris-based art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler purchased the painting in 1924, although a controversy arose over whether the painting was a forgery. It was acquired by art historian Alfred H. Barr Jr. for the New York Museum of Modern Art."
